# KB Open Issues — as of 2026-05-27

All items from the [KB Consistency Review](KB-CONSISTENCY-REVIEW-2026-05-27.md) that have not yet been fixed. Hard contradictions are all resolved. Remaining work is in inconsistencies/terminology drift and intra-article issues.

**Note:** Several section 1 and section 3 entries in the review doc still lack ✅ markers even though the underlying issues were fixed (they were tracked in the prioritization list, not back-marked in the source sections). This list reflects actual fix status, not marker status.

## Section 2 — Inconsistencies / Terminology Drift (17 open)

### Piping / Smart Variables

1. ✅ **Branching logic value of checkboxes** — `[RC-PIPE-04] §6` says REDCap uses "the raw coded value" with no qualification. `[RC-PIPE-02] §5.3` and `[RC-PIPE-01] §8` show checkbox piping returns "Checked"/"Unchecked" text. PIPE-04 needs a checkbox exception note. *(Fixed 2026-05-27: added checkbox exception callout to §6)*

### Longitudinal / Repeating

2. ✅ **Cross-event / cross-instance referencing** — `[RC-BL-05] §5.3` shows working examples and presents the feature positively. `[RC-LONG-02] §8.1` says cross-instance references "are not reliably supported" and tells designers not to depend on them. Same feature, opposite advice. *(Fixed 2026-05-27: RC-LONG-02 §8.1 updated to correctly describe cross-instance referencing as supported, referencing RC-BL-05 §5.3 for full syntax)*

3. ✅ **`format` parameter — Required vs. Optional** — `[RC-API-19] §2` and `[RC-API-20] §2` list `format` as **Required** while documenting a default. `[RC-API-16] §2` correctly marks it **Optional**. Inconsistent across sibling endpoints. *(Fixed 2026-05-27: changed `format` to Optional in RC-API-19 §2 and RC-API-20 §2)*

### Surveys

4. ✅ **Survey Access Code — shortcut vs. authentication gate** — `[RC-SURV-01]` / `[RC-SURV-04]` describe the Survey Access Code as an optional shortcut. `[RC-IMP-07] §3` describes `survey_auth_enabled_single` as a mandatory authentication requirement. The CSV reference conflates the two uses. *(Fixed 2026-05-27: RC-IMP-07 updated — `survey_auth_enabled_single` now correctly described as Survey Login, a per-participant password gate, distinct from the Survey Access Code URL shortcut)*

5. ✅ **Participant Identifier toggle** — `[RC-SURV-05] §3.3` says the identifier feature must be enabled via a column-header button. `[RC-SURV-04] §4.3` and `[RC-SURV-05] §3.1` describe setup with no mention of an enable toggle. *(Fixed 2026-05-27: added Enable button callout to RC-SURV-05 §3.1 and RC-SURV-04 §4.3, including warning about Disable wiping identifiers)*

6. ✅ **ASI Timing Modes coverage gap** — `[RC-SURV-06] §4.3` lists four delay options. `[RC-IMP-06] §3` exposes a fifth (`NEXT_OCCURRENCE`) that the UI article does not describe. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: added `NEXT_OCCURRENCE` bullet to RC-SURV-06 §4.3 with cross-reference to RC-IMP-06)*

### Export

7. ✅ **De-identified rights description** — `[RC-EXPRT-03] §3` says the De-identified level removes "all free-form text fields, date/time fields, and identifier-flagged fields." `[RC-EXPRT-04] §3.2` clarifies that validated text fields (date, number, email) are still included. EXPRT-03 overstates what is removed. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: changed "all free-form text fields" to "unvalidated free-form text fields" and added note that validated text is retained, in both the rights table and the Q&A entry)*

8. ✅ **CSV delimiter options** — `[RC-API-02] §2` lists five delimiters (`,` `tab` `;` `|` `^`). `[RC-IMP-01] §8.1` lists only three. Neither article flags the difference. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: RC-IMP-01 §8.1 delimiter row updated to note pipe and caret are available via API; RC-API-02 §2 csvDelimiter row notes the UI tool only exposes three options)*

### User Rights / DAGs

9. ✅ **`data_export` vs. `data_export_tool`** — `[RC-API-22]` (Users endpoint) uses `data_export`; `[RC-API-26]` (Roles endpoint) uses `data_export_tool`. RC-API-26 acknowledges the divergence in its own Common Mistakes note but the asymmetry between sibling endpoints is undocumented in RC-API-22. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: added matching Common Mistakes entry to RC-API-22 §7)*

10. ✅ **Logging — accepted `logtype` values** — `[RC-LOG-01] §5.2` lists one set of values. `[RC-API-39] §3` adds `'record'` and uses slightly different forms. API consumers cannot tell from either article whether `'record'` is a valid value. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: added note to RC-LOG-01 §5.2 that `'record'` is a valid API-only aggregate logtype; RC-API-39 §3 logtype row updated to explain what `'record'` returns)*

11. ✅ **Users-export columns** — `[RC-USER-02] §7.1` documents `data_access_group_id` and `data_access_group_label`. `[RC-API-22] §5.1` lists only `data_access_group`. Same export, two different schemas. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: added `data_access_group_id` and `data_access_group_label` to RC-API-22 §5.1 attribute list with a note on which field is the functional key)*

### MyCap / Mobile

12. ✅ **MyCap app link domain** — `[RC-MYCAP-04] §2` uses `app.projectmycap.org`. `[RC-PIPE-16] §3` example output uses `https://mycap.link/join/…`. Two different domains for the same `[mycap-participant-url]` output. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: RC-PIPE-16 §3 example URL updated to `app.projectmycap.org`; added domain note with cross-reference to RC-MYCAP-04)*

13. ✅ **Mobile App action tag count** — `[RC-AT-11] §1` says REDCap provides **three** mobile-exclusive action tags. `[RC-MOB-01] §15` lists five, adding `@HIDDEN-APP` and `@READONLY-APP`. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: RC-AT-11 §1 updated to state five total, covering three in this article, with cross-reference to RC-AT-02 for the remaining two)*

### Control Center

14. ✅ **System-wide upload size default** — `[RC-CC-05]` says the server default is typically **1024 MB**. `[RC-CC-24] §9` gives the typical global default as **128 MB**. Order-of-magnitude disagreement. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: clarified in both articles that these are different layers — PHP server ceiling (1024 MB) vs. REDCap application-level defaults (128 MB); each article now cross-references the other)*

15. ✅ **`0` semantics for Record Limit** — `[RC-CC-02]` says a value of `0` means **no limit** (global setting). `[RC-CC-24] §9` says project-level `0` means **use global default**. Same sentinel, two definitions. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: both articles now explain the two-level sentinel — global `0` = no limit; project `0` = defer to global default; each cross-references the other)*

### Miscellaneous

16. ✅ **Calendar export apps** — `[RC-CAL-01] §6` lists Zoho Calendar; `[RC-CAL-01] §7 Q` drops it. Minor intra-article list mismatch. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: added Zoho Calendar to the §7 Q&A app list)*

17. ✅ **DET vs. ASI/Alert API triggering** — `[RC-API-01] §8` flatly says the API cannot trigger the Data Entry Trigger (DET). `[RC-API-01] §9` hedges for alerts: "not triggered by API imports in the same way." The hedge leaves API users without clear guidance. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: §9 gotcha rewritten to distinguish by trigger type — completion/combination don't fire on API writes, logic triggers do; new Q&A added to §8 parallel to the DET question)*

## Section 3 — Intra-article Issues (10 open)

18. ✅ **`[RC-BL-05] §3 / §3.1`** — Defines cross-event prefix as a "different event" construct, then states the current event's own name can also be used as a prefix. Needs a clarifying note. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: converted §3.1 Tip to a Note explaining the underlying rule — the prefix syntax accepts any event name including the current one; prefix is required only for different events)*

19. ✅ **`[RC-PIPE-16] §5`** — One Q&A answer ends mid-sentence: "*See [RC-INST-01 …]*" — the answer is truncated. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: completed the answer — added "contact your REDCap administrator" guidance and closed the sentence with a proper link)*

20. ✅ **`[RC-LONG-03]`** — Section numbering is broken throughout: `# 11` followed by `## 10.1`, `## 10.2`; `# 13` followed by `## 12.1`, `## 12.2`; `# 14` followed by `## 13.1`. Multiple heading/subsection number mismatches. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: renumbered all three broken subsection blocks — §11.1–11.5, §13.1–13.5, §14.1–14.5 — leaving §12's correct numbering intact)*

21. ✅ **`[RC-API-23] §3.1 vs §5.1`** — Attribute reference uses canonical field names (`lock_records_all_forms`, `data_quality_create`, `logging`); code examples use different names (`lock_record_multiform`, `data_quality_design`, `data_logging`, `graphical`). Copy-pasted code will not match the documented schema. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: updated all four code examples — Python, R, cURL, PHP — to use canonical names from §3.1)*

22. ✅ **`[RC-API-26] §2.1 vs §3.1`** — Python example sets `'data_access_group': 1`, contradicting the article's own claim (and `[RC-USER-02]`'s) that roles cannot carry a DAG assignment. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: removed `data_access_group` from all four code examples — Python, R, cURL, PHP — and corrected the cURL block's `data_export` to `data_export_tool` to match §2.1 canonical names)*

23. ✅ **`[RC-DAG-01] §6 vs [RC-DE-09] §4`** — DAG-01 says the Switcher does not override the primary DAG for record attribution (new records still go to the primary DAG). DE-09 says records created after switching are attributed to the switched-to DAG. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: RC-DAG-01 §6 corrected — new records go to the currently active DAG, not the primary assignment; cross-reference to RC-DE-09 §4 added)*

24. ✅ **`[RC-DDE-01] §4 vs §8`** — §4 defines deterministic visibility for DDE roles. §8 says visibility for unassigned users is "non-deterministic depending on REDCap version and configuration." *(Fixed 2026-05-29: added "No DDE role assigned" row to §4 table with version-dependent caveat, plus a Note directing readers to §8; §8 unchanged)*

25. ✅ **`[RC-NAV-REC-01] §4`** — Uses "Incomplete" to label both Grey (no data saved) and Red (saved but status not updated). `[RC-DE-02] §6` reserves "Incomplete" for Red only. Also overloads status codes 1 and 2 across form-status and survey-completion systems without distinguishing them. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: Grey row relabeled "Not started"; Technical Note rewritten to distinguish `[instrument_complete]` form codes from separate survey completion codes)*

26. ✅ **`[RC-DE-02] §3.2 vs [RC-DE-05] §2 / §5`** — DE-02 implies min/max validation is enforced on save ("REDCap enforces the format on save and shows an error"). DE-05 and FD-06 say min/max are soft warnings by default. *(Fixed 2026-05-29: added clarifying sentences to RC-DE-02 §3.2 distinguishing hard format enforcement from soft min/max defaults; updated Number row to flag `@FORCE-MINMAX`)*

27. ✅ **`[RC-DE-11] §3 vs §8`** — §3 says the floating save menu is "always visible while scrolling." §8 says it "may not display every available option depending on screen size and context." *(Fixed 2026-05-29: RC-DE-11 §3 bullet updated to describe the floating menu as a condensed set that may show fewer options — making §8's caveat unsurprising)*
