# 1. Overview

The Export a File (File Repository) API method downloads a single file stored in the project's **File Repository** by its `doc_id`. The method returns the **raw file content** (the bytes of the file itself) — not JSON, CSV, or XML data. Callers must write the response to disk (or a byte stream) rather than treating it as text.

Because this method acts on a specific file by `doc_id`, you normally discover the `doc_id` first by calling List Files and Folders (RC-API-46), which enumerates the files in a given folder and returns each file's `doc_id`. Export a File is the File Repository analogue of Export File (RC-API-12), which downloads a file from a record-level file-upload field. The two methods look similar but operate on different storage areas of the project.

# 2. Key Concepts & Definitions

### Doc ID
A numeric identifier assigned to each file in the File Repository. Obtained by calling List Files and Folders (RC-API-46) and used to export, delete, or otherwise act upon a specific file.

### File Repository
The project-level centralized file storage area, distinct from record-level file-upload fields. Contains shared documents and auto-generated files accessible through folder structure with optional access restrictions.

### Binary File Content
The raw bytes of the file itself (as opposed to metadata or structured data). The API response body on success is the unencoded binary content, which must be written to disk rather than parsed as JSON or text.

---

# 3. Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | Required | The API token specific to your REDCap project and username. Each token is unique per user per project. Requires API Export privileges **and** File Repository privileges in the project. |
| `content` | Required | Always `'fileRepository'` for this method. |
| `action` | Required | Always `'export'` for this method. |
| `doc_id` | Required | The `doc_id` of the specific file in the File Repository to download. |
| `returnFormat` | Optional | `csv`, `json`, or `xml` — specifies the format of **error messages only**. Does not affect the returned file content. If omitted, defaults to `xml`. Does not apply to background process calls — in that case, the response is `success:true` or `success:false` in the response format. |

Note: this method has **no `format` parameter**, because the body of a successful response is binary file content rather than a structured data format. `returnFormat` only controls how error messages are serialized.

---

# 4. Permissions Required

To call this method, the API token's owner must have **both** of the following in the project:

- **API Export** privilege
- **File Repository** privilege

In addition, the user's DAG and User Role assignments must grant access to the folder containing the target file. Attempting to export a file that sits in a DAG- or Role-restricted folder the user cannot see will fail.

---

# 5. Endpoint

```
POST https://your-redcap-instance.edu/api/
```

Only `POST` is supported.

---

# 6. Request Examples

## 6.1 Python

```python
from config import config
import requests

fields = {
    'token': config['api_token'],
    'content': 'fileRepository',
    'action': 'export',
    'doc_id': 201,
    'returnFormat': 'json'
}

r = requests.post(config['api_url'], data=fields)

print('HTTP Status: ' + str(r.status_code))

# Write the binary response to disk
with open('/tmp/exported_file.bin', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(r.content)
```

> **Tip:** The filename and MIME type can be recovered from the response's `Content-Disposition` and `Content-Type` headers when present.

## 6.2 R

```r
source('config.R')
library(RCurl)

result <- postForm(
    api_url,
    token=api_token,
    content='fileRepository',
    action='export',
    doc_id='201',
    returnFormat='json',
    binary=TRUE
)
writeBin(result, '/tmp/exported_file.bin')
```

## 6.3 cURL

```sh
. ./config

$CURL -d "token=$API_TOKEN" \
      -d "content=fileRepository" \
      -d "action=export" \
      -d "doc_id=201" \
      -d "returnFormat=json" \
      -o /tmp/exported_file.bin \
      $API_URL
```

The `-o` flag writes the raw response body to a file, which is what you want for binary content.

## 6.4 PHP

```php
<?php

include 'config.php';

$fields = array(
    'token'        => $GLOBALS['api_token'],
    'content'      => 'fileRepository',
    'action'       => 'export',
    'doc_id'       => 201,
    'returnFormat' => 'json'
);

$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $GLOBALS['api_url']);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fields);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, FALSE); // Set to TRUE for production use
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, 10);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, "POST");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT, 1);

$output = curl_exec($ch);
file_put_contents('/tmp/exported_file.bin', $output);
```

> **Note:** In PHP examples, `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` is shown as `FALSE` for compatibility. Set it to `TRUE` in production. See RC-API-01 — Section 3.5 for why SSL certificate validation matters.

# 7. Response

On success, the response **body is the raw contents of the file** (binary data). The HTTP status code will be 200. Filename and MIME type information is typically provided via response headers (e.g., `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="consent_form_v3.pdf"` and `Content-Type: application/pdf`).

On error, the response body is an error message serialized in the format specified by `returnFormat` (or `xml` by default).

When called as a background process (`backgroundProcess=true`), the response is `success:true` or `success:false` in the appropriate format instead of the file contents.

# 8. Common Questions

**Q: How do I find the `doc_id` of the file I want to export?**

**A:** Call List Files and Folders (RC-API-46) on the folder that contains the file. Each file entry in the response includes a `doc_id`. If the file is nested under a sub-folder, call List on the parent folder first to get the sub-folder's `folder_id`, then call List again on that sub-folder to find the file's `doc_id`.

**Q: Why can't I see the exported file in my terminal or browser when I run the request?**

**A:** The response body is raw binary content, not text. Printing it to a terminal can garble non-text bytes. Always write the response to a file (using `-o` in cURL, `r.content` with `wb` in Python, `writeBin` in R, etc.) and open it with a viewer appropriate to the file type (PDF viewer, image viewer, spreadsheet app, etc.).

**Q: How do I recover the original filename and extension?**

**A:** The original filename is provided in the `Content-Disposition` response header, and the MIME type is provided in `Content-Type`. If your HTTP client exposes response headers, you can use those to save the file with its original name and detect its type.

**Q: What's the difference between this method and Export File (RC-API-12)?**

**A:** RC-API-12 exports a file from a **record-level file-upload field** — the file is attached to a specific record through a field on an instrument. RC-API-47 exports a file from the **project-level File Repository**, which is a shared, project-wide file store separate from record data. They use different `content` values (`file` vs `fileRepository`) and different parameters (RC-API-12 takes `record`/`field`/`event`, RC-API-47 takes `doc_id`).

**Q: Is there a file size limit?**

**A:** The API respects the same file size limits the File Repository imposes in the web UI. Very large files may require increased timeouts on your HTTP client.

**Q: Can I export a whole folder's worth of files in one call?**

**A:** No. This method exports one file per call, identified by `doc_id`. To bulk-download a folder, first call List (RC-API-46) to enumerate the `doc_id`s, then iterate and call Export a File for each.

# 9. Common Mistakes & Gotchas

**Treating the response as JSON or text.** The body on success is raw file bytes. Parsing it as JSON or decoding it as UTF-8 will corrupt binary files (PDFs, images, Office docs, zip archives). Write the response directly to disk in binary mode and then open it as the appropriate file type.

**Confusing `doc_id` with `folder_id` or `record_id`.** `doc_id` uniquely identifies a file in the File Repository. Passing a `folder_id` (from a list response) or a record's primary key will not work — you will get a not-found or permissions error. Confirm you are passing the identifier that came from the `doc_id` field of a List response.

**Assuming the caller sees every file in the project.** If the target file lives inside a folder restricted to a DAG or User Role that the API token owner is not part of, the export will fail. For an audit or full-backup use case, use a token owned by a user with unrestricted access across the project's folders.

**Forgetting that `returnFormat` only shapes errors.** Setting `returnFormat=json` does not wrap the file contents in JSON. On success, the response body remains the raw file. `returnFormat` only affects how errors are returned when something goes wrong.

**Using this method to download files from record file-upload fields.** Record-attached files are not in the File Repository — use RC-API-12 (Export File) for those. The two endpoints look superficially similar but pull from different storage areas.
