description: Use this skill when the user wants to convert a REDCap training outline (uploaded as a Word document) into a RAG-optimized Knowledge Base article in the RC-KB format. Triggers include: uploading a training outline .docx, asking to "convert this outline", "build a KB article", "turn this into a KB article", or any request to produce a new RC-[DOMAIN]-[NN] article from source material. Also trigger when the user says things like "let's do the next outline" or "here's the next one". Do NOT trigger for editing or refining existing articles — use the redcap-kb-refiner skill for that.

# REDCap KB Article Builder

This skill converts a raw REDCap training outline (Word document) into a single, RAG-optimized Knowledge Base article following the RC-KB standard format.

## What you're producing

A `.md` KB article that:
- Covers exactly one concept or workflow (one retrieval query pattern)
- Follows the 8-section template (see below)
- Is optimized for LLM retrieval — explicit Q&A pairs, consistent terminology, surfaced edge cases
- Is institution-agnostic in its core content
- Is ready for RAG ingestion into Yale's local LLM

Write the output directly as a markdown file using the Write tool — no docx skill needed.

---

## Step 0: Verify repo access (run before anything else)

Check whether the KB repo is mounted by testing whether the `kb/` directory is accessible:

```
/sessions/.../mnt/REDCap_KB_RAG/kb/
```

- **If accessible** → proceed to Step 1.
- **If not accessible** → call `mcp__cowork__request_cowork_directory` with path `/Users/bas/REDCap_KB_RAG` to mount it. Do not proceed until access is confirmed.

Do this every time the skill runs, even if the repo was accessible in a previous session — mounts do not persist between sessions.

---

## Step 1: Read and analyze the outline

When the user uploads a Word document:

1. Read the uploaded `.docx` from `/mnt/user-data/uploads/`
2. Identify all chapters or sections in the outline
3. Assess whether the outline maps to one article or multiple — see **Scope decisions** below
4. Present your assessment to the user before proceeding: list the proposed article(s), their proposed IDs, and your rationale. Wait for confirmation.

### Scope decisions

**Merge into one article** when chapters cover a single retrieval query pattern — a user asking one question would need all of them. Example: "What is branching logic?" and "Where is branching logic configured?" belong together.

**Split into separate articles** when chapters cover fundamentally different retrieval patterns — a user asking about topic A would never need topic B in the same lookup. Each gets its own article ID.

When in doubt, ask rather than decide unilaterally.

---

## Step 2: Read the Reference Files & Determine the Article ID

Before assigning an ID, read both:

```
meta/KB-INDEX.md
meta/KB-CROSS-REFS.md
```

Use these to:
- Confirm the next available number in the relevant domain (from the index)
- Check whether any articles the new article will reference are already written (vs. marked ⚠️ as missing)
- Identify articles that should gain an inbound link to the new article once it's added

### Domain slug double-check (run every time)

Cross-check the proposed domain slug against the **Reference: Established domain slugs** table at the bottom of this skill file. This table is the canonical source.

- **Slug exists in the table** → use it as-is.
- **Slug is not in the table** → stop. Tell the user: the proposed slug (e.g. `IMP`) is not yet established, show them what you'd add, and ask for confirmation before proceeding. Once confirmed, add the new slug row to the table at the bottom of this skill file.
- **Slug exceeds 5 characters** → flag it immediately; propose a shorter alternative and confirm with the user.

Article IDs follow this format:
```
RC-[DOMAIN]-[NN]
RC-[DOMAIN]-[SUBDOMAIN]-[NN]
```

Rules:
- `RC` prefix always
- DOMAIN: uppercase, max 5 characters (e.g., NAV, RAND, DAG, BL, FD, DE)
- Subdomain: optional, uppercase, max 3 characters — use when a domain has two or more clearly distinct article groups
- Two-digit zero-padded numbers (01, 02, 03...)
- Subdomain numbers restart at 01 under each parent
- **IDs are permanent once assigned** — confirm with the user before finalizing

Filename format:
```
RC-[DOMAIN]-[NN]_[Descriptive-Title-In-Title-Case].md
```

---

## Step 3: Write the article

Produce the article using the 8-section structure below. Use the BL series (RC-BL-01 through RC-BL-04) as the canonical style reference — these are the most recent articles in the corpus.

### 8-Section Template

#### Metadata table (top of document, before Section 1)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Article ID | RC-[DOMAIN]-[NN] |
| Domain | [Full domain name, e.g. Branching Logic] |
| Applies To | [Project types / conditions] |
| Prerequisite | [Article ID — Title, or "None"] |
| Version | 1.0 |
| Last Updated | [Year] |
| Author | REDCap Support |
| Related Topics | [RC-XX-NN — Title; RC-XX-NN — Title] |

#### Section 1: Overview
One paragraph. Plain-language description of what this article covers. Write as if explaining to someone who has never opened REDCap. No jargon without definition. State what series this article belongs to if applicable.

#### Section 2: Key Concepts & Definitions
Define every term used in the article as REDCap uses it. Note cases where REDCap's terminology differs from common usage. Each definition is a subsection header (H2) with a paragraph below it.

#### Section 3: [Topic-specific procedural content]
Step-by-step procedures, reference tables, or structured explanations. Use subsections (3.1, 3.2...) for distinct sub-tasks or phases. This section's title should reflect the content — not always "Step-by-Step Procedure."

#### Section 4–6: [Additional procedural or reference content as needed]
Add sections for distinct phases, feature areas, or reference tables. Not every article needs 8 content sections — combine or omit as appropriate. Always maintain the Q&A and Gotchas sections.

#### Section N-1: Common Questions
At least 5 Q&A pairs. Write questions exactly as a real user would ask them — this format directly improves LLM retrieval accuracy. Answers must be direct and complete. Avoid "it depends" without explaining what it depends on.

#### Section N: Common Mistakes & Gotchas
At least 3 entries. Each entry covers: what the user does wrong, what happens as a result, and how to prevent or recover. Use a bold lead phrase for each entry.

#### Final section: Related Articles
Bullet list of related KB articles with ID and title. Include prerequisites, natural next articles, and adjacent topics.

## Handling out-of-scope topics within a new article

When writing a new article, you will often need to mention topics that fall outside its scope. **Never use bare "out of scope" language.** Instead, always provide a pointer:

- **If an article already exists** — link by ID and title: `see RC-FD-07 — Field Embedding`
- **If an article is planned** — use the *(coming soon)* flag: `see RC-BL-05 — Branching Logic in Longitudinal Projects *(coming soon)*`
- **If no article exists and none is planned** — add an entry to `kb/KB-GAPS-TODO.md` first, then use the *(coming soon)* flag with the new planned ID.

To check whether a topic is already planned, read `kb/KB-GAPS-TODO.md` before writing the scope sections of the article. Do not leave scope callouts without a pointer.

---

## Style rules (derived from BL series)

- **Terminology**: Use REDCap's canonical terms. "Instrument" not "form" or "survey" unless distinguishing. "Variable" not "field" unless quoting the UI.
- **Voice**: Direct, instructional. No filler phrases ("It's important to note that...").
- **Tables**: Use for reference content with 3+ rows. Don't use tables for 2-item comparisons — prose is cleaner.
- **Notes and warnings**: Use blockquotes (`> **Note:**`, `> **Important:**`, `> **Critical:**`) for callouts.
- **Cross-references**: Always include both the article ID and title: `RC-BL-02 — Syntax & Atomic Statements`
- **One concept per article**: If you find yourself writing "this article also covers...", that's a signal to split.

---

## RAG optimization checklist

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Article covers exactly one retrieval query pattern
- [ ] Q&A pairs use natural language a user would actually type
- [ ] All REDCap-specific terms are defined in Section 2
- [ ] Edge cases and gotchas are explicitly surfaced (not buried)
- [ ] Cross-references use full ID + title format
- [ ] Terminology is consistent throughout (no synonym drift)
- [ ] No institution-specific content in the core sections (see below)

---

## Institutional policy section

If the article touches on behavior that varies by institution (e.g., Production mode approval workflows, administrator intervention policies, local support contacts), add a clearly marked callout box at the relevant point:

```
> **Yale-specific:** [Describe what varies and what Yale's policy is —
> leave blank until confirmed with Yale REDCap support team]
```

This placeholder signals to future editors where local policy needs to be inserted without contaminating the institution-agnostic core content.

---

## Output

### Steps

1. Write the `.md` file directly to `kb/` in the repo: `/sessions/.../mnt/REDCap_KB_RAG/kb/RC-[DOMAIN]-[NN]_[Title].md`
2. Use `present_files` to share it with the user
3. Update the Reference Map (see below)
4. Summarize in 2–3 sentences: article ID, title, section count, and any scope decisions made

Do not explain the entire article back to the user — they can read the document.

---

## Updating the Reference Files

After the article is written and saved, update both `meta/KB-INDEX.md` and `meta/KB-CROSS-REFS.md`. Make all three changes — ideally two edits, one per file:

### 1. Add to the Article Index table — edit `meta/KB-INDEX.md`

Insert a new row in alphabetical/numerical order by Article ID:

```
| RC-[DOMAIN]-[NN] | [Title] | RC-[DOMAIN]-[NN]_[Title-In-Title-Case].md |
```

Note: the filename in the index uses `.md` (the RAG corpus version), not `.docx`.

### 2. Add a Per-Article Reference Details section — edit `meta/KB-CROSS-REFS.md`

Insert a new `###` section in document order (matching the Article Index order). Use this structure:

```markdown
### RC-[DOMAIN]-[NN] — [Title]

**Prerequisites:** [RC-XX-NN — Title, or "None"]

**Outbound links:**
- RC-XX-NN — [Title]
- ...

**Inbound links (referenced by):**
- [Leave blank or list any articles already in the corpus that reference this new article]
```

Mark any outbound link target that doesn't exist yet in the corpus with ⚠️.

### 3. Update inbound links of referenced articles — edit `meta/KB-CROSS-REFS.md`

For every article the new article references, find its Per-Article Reference Details section in `meta/KB-CROSS-REFS.md` and add the new article to its **Inbound links** list. If the new article is a prerequisite of another existing article, note that too.
