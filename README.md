# REDCap KB RAG

A structured knowledge base of REDCap documentation articles, built for ingestion into a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Each article is written to be retrieved and interpreted by an LLM in response to user queries about REDCap features, workflows, and configuration.

## Purpose

This repo supports an LLM-powered REDCap assistant. Rather than feeding raw documentation into the model, each KB article covers a single, well-scoped concept and is formatted to maximize retrieval accuracy and response quality.

## How to Search This KB

**Step 1 — Find the right article:** Read `meta/KB-INDEX.md`. It is a compact table of every article by ID, title, and filename. Scan titles and domain prefixes to identify candidates, then read the article file(s) directly from `kb/`.

**Step 2 — Can't find it by title?** Read `meta/KB-KEYWORD-MAP.md`. It maps common user phrasings, synonyms, and ambiguous topics to the relevant domain or article ID. Use it when the question doesn't obviously map to a domain name (e.g. "prevent retaking" → RC-SURV, "prepopulate" → RC-PIPE).

**Step 3 — Need related articles?** Read `meta/KB-CROSS-REFS.md` to find prerequisites and follow-on articles for a given ID. This file is large — only load it when you need dependency or cross-reference information, not for simple lookups.

**Domain routing:** Articles are grouped by domain prefix (e.g. `RC-SURV` for surveys, `RC-BL` for branching logic). The domain table below maps prefixes to topic areas. See the **Disambiguation Notes** section below the table for topics that could belong to more than one domain.

## Disambiguation Notes

Some topics could map to more than one domain. Use these rules to pick the right one:

| Question type | Go to |
|---|---|
| Sending automated emails or SMS | RC-ALERT (triggered notifications) vs RC-SURV-06 (survey invitations — pick based on whether it's survey-related) |
| Hiding or showing fields | RC-BL (branching logic — field appears/disappears based on logic) vs RC-AT-02 (@HIDDEN/@READONLY — static or action-tag-driven) vs RC-FDL (form display logic — hides entire forms, not individual fields) |
| Exporting data | RC-EXPRT (UI-based reports and exports) vs RC-API (programmatic export via API) |
| Importing data | RC-IMP (CSV upload via UI) vs RC-API (programmatic import via API) |
| File uploads | RC-FD (file-upload field type in an instrument) vs RC-API-12–15 (API methods for record-level files) vs RC-API-45–49 (API methods for File Repository) vs RC-FILE (File Repository UI — uploading, folders, sharing, access restrictions) |
| Calculations / formulas | RC-CALC (calculated fields, special functions) vs RC-AT-09 (@CALCTEXT / @CALCDATE action tags) |
| Translations / multilingual | RC-MLM (Multi-Language Management — UI and instrument translation) vs RC-AI-03 (AI translation tool) |
| Mobile data collection | RC-MOB (REDCap Mobile App — staff-facing offline data entry) vs RC-MYCAP (MyCap — participant-facing mobile app) |
| Prepopulating fields | RC-PIPE (piping and smart variables) vs RC-AT-06 (autofill action tags) |
| Survey access / links | RC-SURV (survey setup and settings) vs RC-PIPE (smart variable survey links) |
| Locking records | RC-LOCK (record locking and e-signatures) vs RC-USER (user rights that govern lock/unlock permissions) |
| Audit trail / who changed what | RC-LOG (logging and audit trail) vs RC-DQ (Data Quality — rule-based checks on data values) |

## Article Format

Each article is written for RAG retrieval using an 8-section template:

1. **Overview** — what the feature is and when it applies
2. **Key concepts** — definitions and terminology
3. **Step-by-step workflow** — how to use the feature
4. **Q&A pairs** — anticipated user questions with direct answers
5. **Edge cases** — common pitfalls and exceptions
6. **Related articles** — cross-references to prerequisite or follow-on topics
7. **Prerequisites** — what the user needs to know first
8. **Summary** — brief recap for retrieval context

Articles are institution-agnostic in their core content so they can be reused across REDCap environments.

## YAML Conversion

The `kb (YAML)/` folder contains the same articles as `kb/`, converted from a markdown metadata table at the top to standard YAML frontmatter. This format is used by the ServiceNow ETL pipeline.

To regenerate the YAML versions after adding or updating articles in `kb/`:

```bash
python convert_to_yaml_kb.py
```

## Configuration

Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.local.yaml` and fill in the values for your environment. `config.local.yaml` is gitignored and is never committed.

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.local.yaml
```

The config file covers paths for the ServiceNow ETL script, ServiceNow connection credentials (if importing via API), and REDCap instance URLs.

## Claude Skills

The `claude skills/` directory contains Cowork skills that Claude uses to maintain the KB and assist with REDCap work:

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kb-creation` | Convert a `.docx` training outline into a new KB article |
| `kb-update` | Update or correct an existing article based on new information |
| `kb-update-workspace` | Same as kb-update, but works with files already in the mounted workspace folder |
| `kb-search` | Search the KB by topic to find and read relevant articles before writing |
| `redcap-codebook-reader` | Read a Codebook PDF or Data Dictionary CSV and produce a structured project overview |
| `redcap-data-dictionary` | Analyze a REDCap Data Dictionary CSV (field types, instruments, structure) |
| `redcap-dd-builder` | Build a new REDCap Data Dictionary from scratch based on a project description |
| `redcap-dd-fixer` | Diagnose and fix errors in an uploaded Data Dictionary CSV |
| `redcap-longitudinal-builder` | Build Arms, Events, and Instrument Designations CSVs for a longitudinal project |
| `redcap-longitudinal-structure` | Parse and interpret longitudinal project structure from exported Arms/Events/Designations CSVs |
| `redcap-project-analyzer` | Connect to the REDCap API and audit a live project for design issues, logic errors, and structural problems |
| `redcap-syntax-builder` | Write a correct REDCap expression (branching logic, calc field, action tag) from a description |
| `redcap-syntax-builder-workspace` | Same as redcap-syntax-builder, but works with fields from a workspace-mounted Data Dictionary |
| `redcap-syntax-fixer` | Diagnose and fix broken REDCap expressions |
| `redcap-syntax-fixer-workspace` | Same as redcap-syntax-fixer, but resolves field references against a workspace-mounted Data Dictionary |
| `redcap-syntax-reader` | Explain and interpret what an existing REDCap expression does |

## Adding New Articles

New articles are built from source training outline documents or written from scratch using a Claude skill. The workflow is:

1. Open a Cowork session and upload the source `.docx` (or describe the topic)
2. Claude uses the `kb-creation` skill to produce a properly formatted KB article
3. The article is saved to `kb/` and `meta/KB-INDEX.md` and `meta/KB-CROSS-REFS.md` are updated
4. Run `convert_to_yaml_kb.py` to regenerate `kb (YAML)/` if the ServiceNow ETL is being used

## Updating Existing Articles

To revise or correct an article, open a Cowork session and either upload updated source material or describe the change. Claude uses the `kb-update` or `kb-update-workspace` skill to locate the relevant article, apply the edits, and keep `meta/KB-INDEX.md` and `meta/KB-CROSS-REFS.md` in sync.

## Syncing Changes

Changes are committed locally by Claude and pushed to GitHub manually:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "your message"
git push
```
