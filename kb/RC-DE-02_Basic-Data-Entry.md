## 1. Overview

This article covers the mechanics of entering data into a REDCap
instrument. It explains the field types you will encounter, how required
fields and branching logic work, how to set form status, and all
available save options. Understanding these mechanics is required before
entering any data in REDCap.

---

## 2. Key Concepts & Definitions

**Instrument (Form)**

A structured data-entry page within a REDCap project. Each instrument
contains one or more fields (variables). Instruments are opened by
clicking a status dot on the Record Home Page or Record Status
Dashboard.

**Field (Variable)**

A single data-entry element within an instrument. Each field has a type
that determines how data is entered and validated. Field names (variable
names) are how REDCap identifies data internally and in exports.

**Form Status**

A mandatory dropdown field at the bottom of every REDCap instrument,
labeled 'Complete?'. Its value determines the color of the
instrument's status dot. Setting form status is optional for the study
team but strongly recommended for tracking instrument completion.

**Required Field**

A field marked with a red asterisk (\*) that the project designer has
designated as required. REDCap displays a warning if you attempt to save
an instrument with a required field left empty, but the warning can be
dismissed — required fields are a soft constraint for regular users.

**Branching Logic**

A project-level configuration that conditionally shows or hides fields
based on the values of other fields. Branching logic is invisible to the
user — fields simply appear or disappear as data is entered.

**Save Options**

REDCap does not auto-save. Data is only committed to the database when
the user explicitly saves the form using one of the save buttons at the
bottom of every instrument.

## 3. Field Types

REDCap fields fall into two broad categories: structured (constrained
input) and unstructured (free text).

### 3.1 Structured Field Types

Structured fields restrict input to a defined set of options or a
validated format. They reduce entry errors and improve data consistency.

| **Field Type** | **How It Works** |
| --- | --- |
| Radio button | Select exactly one option from a visible list. Cannot be deselected once chosen — use the reset button if available. |
| Dropdown | Select exactly one option from a collapsed list. More compact than radio buttons for long option lists. |
| Checkbox | Select one or more options independently. Each checkbox is stored as a separate yes/no variable in the dataset. |
| Slider | Drag a handle along a scale to select a numeric value. Commonly used for visual analog scales (e.g., pain scores). |
| File upload | Attach a file (PDF, image, etc.) to the record. One file per field per instance. |
| Signature | Capture a drawn signature in the browser. Stored as an image file. |

### 3.2 Unstructured Field Types

Unstructured fields accept free-text input. They can be configured with
optional validation to enforce a format without restricting the user to
a predefined list.

| **Field Type** | **How It Works** |
| --- | --- |
| Text box | Single-line free-text entry. Can have validation applied (see below). |
| Notes box | Multi-line free-text entry. No validation options. Used for comments, narratives, or open-ended responses. |

**Text Box Validation Types**

A text box can be configured with a validation rule that restricts
accepted input to a specific format. REDCap enforces the format on save
and shows an error if the value does not match.

| **Validation Type** | **What It Enforces** |
| --- | --- |
| Date (various formats) | Requires a valid date. Available in multiple regional formats (MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, etc.). |
| Time | Requires a valid time value (HH:MM). |
| Number | Requires a numeric value. Can optionally enforce a min/max range. |
| Integer | Requires a whole number (no decimals). |
| Email | Requires a valid email address format. |
| Phone number | Requires a phone number format (format varies by configuration). |
| Zipcode | Requires a US ZIP code format. |

## 4. Required Fields

A required field is marked with a red asterisk (\*) next to the field
label. If you attempt to save the instrument while a required field is
empty, REDCap displays a warning listing the empty required fields.


> **Important:** Required fields are a soft constraint for regular users. The save warning can be dismissed and the form saved anyway with the required field empty. If your study protocol requires these fields to be filled, enforce compliance through team training and data quality checks — not solely through REDCap's required-field mechanism.


---

## 5. Branching Logic

Branching logic allows the project designer to conditionally show or
hide fields based on the current values of other fields in the same
instrument (or in some configurations, other instruments).

- Fields hidden by branching logic do not appear on the form and their
    values are cleared automatically when the logic hides them.

- Fields revealed by branching logic appear dynamically as you enter
    data — no page reload required.

- **Example:** a 'Are you pregnant?' question may be hidden when
    'Male' is selected in a Sex field. The field reappears if the
    answer changes.

- You cannot manually override branching logic during data entry. If a
    field you expect to see is not visible, it means the logic condition
    has not been met based on current values.


> **Troubleshooting:** If a field seems to be missing from an instrument, check whether branching logic may be hiding it before reporting it as a bug. Changing an earlier field value may reveal it.


---

## 6. Form Status

Every instrument has a Form Status dropdown at the bottom, labeled
'Complete?'. This field controls the color of the instrument's status
dot in the Record Home Page and Record Status Dashboard.

| **Form Status Value** | **Dot Color** | **Meaning & Who Sets It** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (no data saved) | Grey | No data has been entered. Default state. Set automatically by REDCap. |
| Incomplete | Red | Data has been saved but status has not been updated. Default for any saved form. Set automatically by REDCap. |
| Unverified | Yellow | Data entry complete but not yet verified. Set manually by the study team. |
| Complete | Green | Data entry verified and complete. Set manually by the study team. |

- Only grey and red are enforced automatically by REDCap. Yellow and
    green must be set manually.

- Using yellow and green is optional, but strongly recommended for
    projects with many instruments — it makes it easy to distinguish
    instruments that have been reviewed from those that have only been
    partially filled.

- Survey completions have their own status dots (orange checkmark =
    partial survey, green checkmark = completed survey). These are set
    automatically and are separate from the manual form status described
    here.

## 7. Saving Data


> **Critical:** REDCap does not auto-save. If you close the browser tab, navigate away, or click Cancel without saving, all unsaved data on the current form is lost.


Every instrument has the following core save options at the bottom of the page:

| **Save Option** | **What Happens After Saving** |
| --- | --- |
| Save and Exit Form | Saves the form and returns you to the Record Home Page for that record. |
| Save and Stay | Saves the form and remains on the current instrument. Use when making multiple edits or reviewing your entry. |
| Save and Exit Record | Saves the form and returns you to the Add/Edit Records page. Use when you are done with this record entirely. |
| Save and Go to Next Record | Saves the form and opens the same instrument in the next record (by Record ID order). Use for batch data entry across multiple records. |

> **Note:** These core options are available in all instruments. Additional save options appear in specific contexts — for surveys (Save & Mark Survey as Complete) and for repeating instruments (Save & Go To Next Instance, Save & Add New Instance). See [RC-DE-11 — Instrument Save Options](RC-DE-11_Instrument-Save-Options.md) for the complete reference.

> **Warning:** Clicking Cancel on an instrument discards all unsaved changes on that form and returns you to the Record Home Page. There is no undo.

## 8. Common Questions

**Q: A required field has a red asterisk but I need to save the form
without filling it in. Can I?**

**A:** Yes. The required field warning is a soft prompt. You can dismiss the
warning and save the form anyway. REDCap will not block the save.
However, your study's data quality rules may flag this for follow-up.

**Q: A field I expected to see on the form is not there. What
happened?**

**A:** The field is likely hidden by branching logic. Check whether an
earlier field that controls the logic has been filled in correctly. The
hidden field will appear once the branching condition is met.

**Q: What is the difference between the grey dot and the red dot?**

**A:** Grey means no data has been saved to that instrument at all. Red
means data has been saved but the Form Status dropdown is still set to
'Incomplete' (the default). A single saved value is enough to turn a
grey dot red.

**Q: Do I have to set the form status to 'Complete' after every
entry?**

**A:** No. It is optional. However, using yellow and green statuses makes it
much easier to track which records have been reviewed versus just
entered, especially in large projects with many instruments.

**Q: What does 'Save and Go to Next Record' do if I am on the last
record?**

**A:** If there is no next record, REDCap will not navigate further. It
behaves like 'Save and Stay' and you remain on the current form.

**Q: Can I enter data in checkboxes by selecting multiple options?**

**A:** Yes. Checkboxes allow any number of options to be selected
independently. Each checkbox option is stored as a separate yes/no
binary variable in the dataset export.

**Q: What happens to a field hidden by branching logic — is the data
deleted?**

**A:** Yes. When branching logic hides a field, REDCap clears and deletes
any value previously stored in that field. This is by design. If the
field becomes visible again (because the controlling value changed
back), it starts empty.

## 9. Common Mistakes & Gotchas

- Losing data by closing the browser: REDCap does not auto-save.
    Always use one of the save buttons before navigating away.

- Ignoring required field warnings: dismissing the warning is allowed,
    but doing so repeatedly without filling the field will cause data
    quality issues. Build a habit of completing required fields before
    saving.

- Not setting form status: teams that skip the yellow/green status on
    complex projects quickly lose track of which forms have been
    reviewed versus just filled in. Decide on a form status convention
    before data collection begins.

- Confusing grey and red: grey = zero data saved; red = some data
    saved but status not updated. Both are coded as 0 in the dataset but
    have different visual meanings.

- Selecting 'Save and Exit Record' when you meant 'Save and Exit
    Form': these take you to different places. 'Save and Exit Form'
    returns to the Record Home Page; 'Save and Exit Record' returns to
    the Add/Edit Records page.

- Assuming a hidden field is a bug: if a field is not visible, check
    branching logic before reporting a problem. It may be intentionally
    hidden based on another field's value.

### API Access

> **Note:** The following REDCap API methods provide programmatic access to this functionality. API usage is an advanced feature that requires knowledge of computer programming or access to a developer resource. See [RC-API-01 — REDCap API](RC-API-01_REDCap-API.md) for authentication, token management, and setup.
