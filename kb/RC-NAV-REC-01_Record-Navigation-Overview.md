# 1. Overview

This article explains how to navigate to records and locate data within
a REDCap project. It covers the primary navigation paths available to
any REDCap user and explains how to interpret instrument status
indicators (colored dots).

---

# 2. Key Concepts & Definitions

**Record**

The fundamental unit of data in REDCap. Each record corresponds to one
participant, patient, or subject. Every record has a Record ID — the
primary identifier used throughout the system.

**Instrument**

A data-entry form within a REDCap project. Instruments contain fields
(variables) where data is entered. Each instrument has a status dot that
reflects its completion state.

**Record Home Page**

A per-record landing page that displays all instruments associated with
that record. It is the central hub for viewing and navigating to any
instrument for a single record.

**Record Status Dashboard**

A project-level view displaying all records and their instrument
statuses in a grid. Useful for monitoring progress across an entire
study.

**Add/Edit Records Page**

A data-collection menu page that provides lookup tools for finding and
opening individual records.

# 3. Step-by-Step: Primary Navigation Paths

## 3.1 Navigating to a Project

- Log in to your REDCap instance.

- On the My Projects page, click the name of the project you want to
    open.

- You are now on the project home page, with the left-hand menu
    available.

## 3.2 Add/Edit Records (Quickest Path to a Single Record)

- In the left-hand menu, find the Data Collection section and click
    Add / Edit Records.

- To find a record by ID: use the Choose an existing record dropdown
    — it lists all record IDs in the project.

- To search by value: use the Data Search feature.

- Search across all variables — useful when you only know a value
    but not which field contains it.

- Search within a specific variable — faster in large projects
    (e.g., search only the Date of Birth field).

- Selecting a result takes you directly to the Record Home Page or to
    the specific instrument where the value was found.

## 3.3 Record Status Dashboard

- In the left-hand menu, click Record Status Dashboard under Data
    Collection.

- The default dashboard shows all records, events, and instruments you
    have access to.

- Click any colored dot to open the corresponding instrument for that
    record.

## 3.4 Reports

- In the left-hand menu, click Data Exports, Reports, and Stats, then
    select a report.

- Any Record ID displayed in a report is a clickable link that opens
    the Record Home Page for that record.

## 3.5 Using the Record Home Page

- Once on the Record Home Page, you see all instruments for that
    record displayed as colored dots.

- Click any dot to open the corresponding instrument.

- After opening an instrument, the left-hand menu displays a list of
    all instruments for quick switching.

# 4. Instrument Status Dot Colors

Every instrument in REDCap is represented by a colored dot. The color
encodes the completion status of that instrument for a given record.

| **Dot Appearance** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| Grey | Incomplete — no data has been entered. This is the default state. |
| Red | Data has been saved, but the Form Status field is still set to Incomplete. |
| Yellow | Form Status field is set to Unverified by a user. |
| Green | Form Status field is set to Complete by a user. |
| Orange with white checkmark | The instrument was opened as a survey but only partially completed (e.g., participant closed the browser mid-survey). |
| Green with white checkmark | The instrument was completed in full as a survey. |

**Important distinctions:**

- REDCap automatically enforces grey (no data) and red (data present,
    incomplete) statuses.

- Yellow and green statuses are set manually by the study team ---
    they are optional but recommended for projects with many
    instruments.

- Survey statuses (orange and green with checkmarks) are set
    automatically when a survey is submitted or partially completed.


> **Technical Note:** Instrument status values are stored as part of the project dataset and can be manipulated in bulk via data import. Grey and red are both coded as 0; yellow = 1; green = 2. Survey statuses (orange checkmark = 1, green checkmark = 2) only appear when the instrument is used as a survey.

# 5. Common Questions

**Q: What is the fastest way to find a specific record in a large
project?**

**A:** Use Add/Edit Records and the Data Search feature. Searching within a
specific variable (such as Record ID or email) is faster than searching
across all variables.

**Q: Can I navigate to an instrument directly without going through the
Record Home Page?**

**A:** Yes. Clicking any colored dot in the Record Status Dashboard or in a
report takes you directly to the corresponding instrument without
visiting the Record Home Page first.

**Q: What does a red dot mean — is something wrong?**

**A:** No. A red dot simply means data has been entered but the Form Status
field has not been changed from its default value of Incomplete. It does
not indicate an error.

**Q: Can I change instrument statuses for many records at once?**

**A:** Yes. Instrument statuses are stored in the dataset and can be set in
bulk using REDCap\'s data import tools. Use coded values: 0 =
incomplete, 1 = unverified, 2 = complete.

**Q: What happens to the dot color if I enter a single data point but
leave everything else blank?**

**A:** The dot turns red. Any data saved to an instrument — even a single
field — changes the dot from grey to red.

# 6. Common Mistakes & Gotchas

- Confusing grey and red: grey means no data at all; red means data is
    present but the form status has not been updated. They are both
    coded as 0 in the dataset, but have different visual meanings.

- Ignoring optional statuses: teams that skip yellow/green statuses on
    large projects often lose track of which instruments have been
    reviewed vs. just filled in.

- Searching all variables in a large project: this can be slow. Always
    prefer variable-specific search when you know which field to look
    in.

- Expecting survey statuses on non-survey instruments: orange and
    green-checkmark dots only appear on instruments that are enabled as
    surveys.
