## 1. Overview

This article covers action tags designed for radio button and dropdown fields: `@RANDOMORDER`, `@HIDECHOICE`, `@SHOWCHOICE`, and `@MAXCHOICE`. These tags do not work on matrix fields (except `@MAXCHOICE`).

---

## 2. @RANDOMORDER

Randomizes the visual order of options every time a page loads. The underlying raw values and stored data are unaffected — only the display order changes.

**Use case:** Preventing option-order bias in surveys (e.g., respondents systematically choosing the first option).

**Syntax:**
```
@RANDOMORDER
```

**Notes:**
- Works on radio buttons, dropdowns, and checkboxes
- A yes/no field has 2 possible permutations; a 5-option field has 120
- No parameters required

---

## 3. @HIDECHOICE

Hides one or more specific options from a field while preserving those options in records where they were already selected.

> **Note:** If a respondent with a hidden option selected opens the form and saves it without changes, the hidden option is preserved. If they deselect and reselect, the hidden option becomes unavailable.

**Syntax — single option:**
```
@HIDECHOICE='1'
```

**Syntax — multiple options (separate annotations, preferred):**
```
@HIDECHOICE='1' @HIDECHOICE='2'
```

**Syntax — multiple options (comma-separated, use with caution):**
```
@HIDECHOICE='1, 2'
```

Use the raw value of the option(s), not the label. Where multiple options need to be hidden, separate annotations per value are the safest approach — the comma-separated form may not behave consistently across all REDCap versions. Always test before deploying to production.

**Use case:** Marking class spots as filled in a registration form, or hiding expired options while preserving historical selections.

---

## 4. @SHOWCHOICE

The inverse of `@HIDECHOICE`. Starts with all options hidden and shows only the listed ones.

Use `@SHOWCHOICE` when the number of options to hide is larger than the number to show — it is cleaner to list what to show.

**Syntax:**
```
@SHOWCHOICE='1, 2, 3'
```

> **Note:** If both `@HIDECHOICE` and `@SHOWCHOICE` target the same option, `@SHOWCHOICE` takes precedence and the option will be shown.

---

## 5. @MAXCHOICE

Limits how many times a given option can be selected across all project records. Once the limit is reached, the option is greyed out and unavailable to new respondents.

**Syntax:**
```
@MAXCHOICE(1=25,2=30,3=30)
```

Each entry is `raw_value=limit`. Separate multiple entries with commas.

**Important:** `@MAXCHOICE` checks counts on page load only, not in real time. If two respondents load the form simultaneously when one slot remains, both may be able to select it.

**Use case:** Class registration with limited spots, event sign-ups with capacity limits.

**Combining with other tags:**

- `@MAXCHOICE` + `@HIDECHOICE`: Hides the greyed-out option entirely (requires manual monitoring)
- `@MAXCHOICE` + `@RANDOMORDER`: Randomizes option order while enforcing limits

## 6. Common Questions

**Q: Can these tags be combined?**

**A:** Yes. For example, `@MAXCHOICE(1=25) @RANDOMORDER` enforces a limit while randomizing order.

**Q: Do these tags work on matrix fields?**

**A:** `@RANDOMORDER`, `@HIDECHOICE`, and `@SHOWCHOICE` do not work on matrix fields. `@MAXCHOICE` is the exception and does work on matrix fields.

**Q: If I use @HIDECHOICE, will the hidden option still be visible to a respondent who already selected it?**

**A:** Yes. If a previous response has a hidden option selected, that option remains visible and selectable for that record. The hidden option is only removed from the list of available choices for new selections or when a respondent deselects and reselects.

**Q: How does @MAXCHOICE handle simultaneous form submissions?**

**A:** `@MAXCHOICE` checks availability only when the form loads, not in real time. If two respondents load the form when one spot remains and both select it before either saves, both submissions will be accepted. Monitor high-demand fields manually or use other controls if simultaneous access is a concern.

**Q: Can I use @SHOWCHOICE to show options dynamically based on branching logic?**

**A:** No. `@SHOWCHOICE` is a static tag applied at field design time and shows the same options regardless of form context or branching conditions. To show different options based on logic, use branching logic on the field itself or consider using multiple fields with conditional visibility.

## 7. Common Mistakes & Gotchas

**Using the option label instead of the raw value in @HIDECHOICE or @SHOWCHOICE.** These tags require the raw coded value (e.g., `'1'`, `'2'`) not the display label. If you enter the label by mistake, the tag will silently fail and all options will remain visible.

**Assuming @MAXCHOICE enforces the limit with real-time updates.** The count is checked only when the form loads. A gap between when the form loads and when responses are saved can result in overshoots, especially with concurrent participants. Plan for manual review or implement additional controls if capacity limits are strict.

**Mixing @HIDECHOICE and @SHOWCHOICE without understanding precedence.** If both tags target the same option, `@SHOWCHOICE` wins and the option displays. This can be counterintuitive if you intended `@HIDECHOICE` to hide something universally.

**Assuming @HIDECHOICE removes an option from data exports and reports.** `@HIDECHOICE` is a display-only tag — it hides options from the data entry form and surveys but has no effect on exports or the Custom Reports module. Hidden coded values are still present in the data and will appear in exports as-is. If a record was saved with a now-hidden option, that value shows up in every export and report filter just like any other choice. When building reports on fields that use `@HIDECHOICE`, do not assume the hidden values are absent from the data.
