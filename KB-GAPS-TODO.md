# KB Gaps — Articles Still Needed

These articles are referenced by existing KB articles or skills but do not yet exist in the KB.

## Open Gaps


### ⚠️ RC-LOCK-01 — Record Locking & E-Signatures

**Why needed:** Record locking is a significant REDCap feature for clinical data integrity and regulatory workflows. It is mentioned in passing in RC-DE-13 (Record Administration) but has no dedicated article. E-signature support makes this a distinct topic from simple record-level admin actions.

**Domain slug:** LOCK (new domain)
**What to cover:** What record locking does (prevents further edits to a form/record), difference between locking a single instrument vs. entire record; how to enable record locking (project-level setting, user rights required); locking and unlocking workflow; e-signature configuration and user flow; locked form indicators in the UI; interaction with Data Resolution Workflow; locking in longitudinal projects (per-event behavior); audit trail entries for lock/unlock/e-sign events; admin override capabilities

### ⚠️ RC-DE-13 — Record Administration (Choose Action for Record)

**Why needed:** RC-DE-01 calls out the 'Choose action for record' button as out of scope for routine data entry but provides no pointer to a covering article. No existing article covers record-level admin operations.

**Domain slug:** DE (established)
**What to cover:** Accessing 'Choose action for record' from the Record Home Page, available actions (move record to different DAG, rename/renumber record, delete record, lock/unlock record), who can perform each action (user rights required), consequences and irreversibility of deletion, audit trail behavior after admin actions
